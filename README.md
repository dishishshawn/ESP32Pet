# ESP32PET

An open-source Tamagotchi, built on an ESP32 with an ST7735 LCD and physical buttons. 
A digital pet resembling me responds to feeding, playing, and dressing up. 
Stats are persistent (saved to EEPROM)

## Features
- Deep sleep (Battery powered use)
- Three-button UI (+ 1 for on and off)
- Designed for portable use

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 w/ EEPROM storage (ESP32 DevKit V1)
- Arduino framework (Platform IO)
- TFT LCD (ST7735)
- 3.7V LiPo battery + MCP1700 (3.3V LDO)
- 4x momentary push buttons

## Applications
- KiCAD
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

## Additional Notes
Decided to use the full esp32 dev kit for easy testing of new firmware/features.
